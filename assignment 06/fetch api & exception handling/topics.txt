   Q:- fetch api from the server and  do exception handling in that.
	
	solution :-
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)
  const data = await res.json()

  //use this statement for the program not to crush but go back to the home page
  if (!data) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/',
        permanent: false,
      },
    }
  }

  return {
    props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}


Per MDN, the fetch() API only rejects a promise when a “network error is encountered, although this usually means permissions issues or similar.” 
Basically fetch() will only reject a promise if the user is offline, or some unlikely networking error occurs, such a DNS lookup failure.
